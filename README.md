# Vehicle-monitoring-system

Monitoring thousands of vehicles at crowded public places like colleges , business

complex , residential societies ,stadiums,tolls has always been a daunting task to accom-
plish.Inefficient methods lead to compromised security of the public .

Currently watchmen and gate guards are deployed to do this task , which can work for
less populated places. When it comes to keeping track of abundant number of vehicles
moving in and out of a place humans method fall short. e purpose of this project is to

design and implement a Vehicle monitoring system ( Surveillance ) which can automati-
cally recognize a vehicle based on its number plate and allow the registered vehicles inside

the premises . e entry and exit times are also recorded. is resulted in the elimina-
tion of the pen and paper that were required in the registration process and introduced

a faster electronic means of vehicle identification and vehicle registration as well as an
easier means of vehicle data storage and vehicle data sharing.
e software developed implements Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using the
device camera to detect and capture the vehicle number plate.


# Problem Statement

Create an affordable solution through image processing for the detection, Identification
andmonitoring of vehiclesin different scenario such as residential, societies,tolls,business
complex etc.
